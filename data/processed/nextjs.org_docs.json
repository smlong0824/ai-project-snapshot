You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations. It also automatically configures lower-level tools like bundlers and compilers. You can instead focus on building your product and shipping quickly. Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications. The docs are organized into 3 sections: Getting Started: Step-by-step tutorials to help you create a new application and learn the core Next.js features. Guides: Tutorials on specific",

The App Router and Pages Router handle React versions differently: App Router: Uses React canary releases built-in, which include all the stable React 19 changes, as well as newer features being validated in frameworks, prior to a new React release. Pages Router: Uses the React version installed in your project's package.json. This approach ensures new React features work reliably in the App Router while maintaining backwards compatibility for existing Pages Router applications.
